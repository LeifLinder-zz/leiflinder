        <personalitytype>
        INTP
        </personalitytype>
        <personality>
        <p>I am a highly creative person according to personality testing and rely heavily on intuition. I am mostly interested in the heavy subjects and am not great at small talk but can become quite passionate when talking about ideas or concepts.</p>
        <p>Although I have an INTP personality type I am not a cold nerd and I truly care about people's feelings. My empathy for people is high and I am concerned about the generally happiness of my workplace and maintaining personal communications by always treating my coworkers with respect. I don't gossip or create unwarranted drama.</p>
