    <aboutme>
    <p>I am orginally from a city call Seattle in state of Washington. Washington is just below Canada in the upper Northwest corner of America. I moved to New York City when I turned 30 but lived for a short time im London and Alaska beforehand. In New York City I had two distinct careers first in the Stock Photography industry and then as a PHP web developer for several companies.</p>
<p>Later our small family moved to Oslo Norway. My wife is a Norwegian national and so we thought it would be fun to try and live there for a while. In the course of 4 years I studied Norwegian language and passed my B1 language certification in addition to working a non professional job and continuing code training.</p>
