<p>I would like to write code professionally for a small team and develop a close working relationship with my coworking to develop interesting web applications. I like the enthusiasm of new projects and working with passionate people who easily communicate their ideas.</p>
<p>I like to think big and deep and I enjoy working with people who have opions and who want to make something special. I would like to work someplace where my designs and code are appreciated and I am given some freedom to experiment to new concepts.</p>
